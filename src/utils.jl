"""
    trunclo(x::Union{Float32,Float64})

Truncates the lower order bits of `x` so that the result of the multiplication `trunclo(x)
* trunclo(y)` is exact, assuming no underflow or overflow occurs.

This relies on the following property: if `a` has `n` significant bits, and `b` has `m`
significant bits, then exact product `a*b` has either `n+m-1` or `n+m` significant bits:

* `Float64` has 53 significant bits (including implicit leading bit), so we need to
  truncate the last 27 significant bits (leaving 26 bits).

* `Float32` has 24 significant bits (including implicit leading bit), so we need to
  truncate the last 12 significant bits (leaving 12 bits).

This is typically faster than other methods of truncating lower order bits (such as
Veltkamp splitting, or converting `Float64`s to `Float32`s and back again). For LLVM 3.8
or greater, this should give optimal `ANDPD`/`ANDSD` instructions on supported x86
architectures, which doesn't require moving registers (Julia issue #9868).

NOTE: For odd significand sizes, such as `Float64`, when used as a replacement Veltkamp
splitting for computing extended precision multiplications with a Dekker-style `mul12`
algorithm, it can lose the last bit of precision. For example the function:

    function incorrect_mul2(x,y)
        hx = trunclo(x); tx = x-hx
        hy = trunclo(y); ty = y-hy
        p = hx*hy
        q = hx*ty + tx*hy
        z = p+q
        zz = p-z+q+tx*ty
        z, zz
    end
    
will give an incorrect result for the case `x = y = 0x1.800000e000001p+0`.
